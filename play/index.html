SOCIAL & PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES UNIT:OFFICIAL BRIEFING

The situation

There has been an outbreak of new, infectious disease in Edinburgh.

Scientists from the Social & Public Health Sciences Unit have reason to believe that the disease is going to spread to Glasgow, and fast.

A vaccine has been created, but supplies are low…

Your help is needed!

The scientists need to know which Glasgow school is most likely to be hit by the disease first, so they can dispatch the vaccine and prevent the disease spreading

What we know so far

The scientists believe that people who live in cities are at highest risk. Because they are busier and it is harder for people to keep 2 meters apart.

Schools that have lots of pupils who live in cities will be most at risk.





Hello, I'm the Chief Scientist. There has been an outbreak of an infectious disease at a school in a neighbouring area and we want to identify which school is going to be hit next.

You will be assigned a set of data to analyse.

You’ll need to work as quickly as possible to identify the school using the data we have gathered.


You’ll be divided into two teams: the Environment Team and the Employment team. Your Challenge is to find out which Glasgow school is most likely to be hit by the disease first, so we can dispatch the vaccine and prevent the disease spreading.
