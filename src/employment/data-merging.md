# Data merging

Thanks for sharing your data with the other team. To the right of your dataset, you'll see the dataset that the Environment team has shared with you – enter their risk score into your main dataset, using the Sharing ID



<!--


When communication officers return with signed agreement, hand them the Sharing dataset and the linkage key. If one arrives before the other, ask them to wait for a moment while you finish something important. Once both communication officers have arrived:
  <form id="myForm" ><input name="fullName" class="clearinput" type="text" class="b-none" readonly><br>
 </form>-->
