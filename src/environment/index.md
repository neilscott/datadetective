You hold neighbourhood data on Glasgow, which tells you which pupils live in cities.

This is really useful data to have, because the environments in which we live can affect our health.

For example, being near green space can help you be physically active, and pollution can affect your breathing.

The scientists believe that people who live in cities are at highest risk because it is harder for people to keep 2 meters apart.

Schools that have lots of pupils who live in cities will be most at risk of getting the disease first. So youâ€™re going to need to use these data to work out which school is at highest risk.
