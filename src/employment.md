You hold Employment data on Glasgow. This is really useful data to have, because the jobs that people have can affect your health.

For example, people who work on building sites are more likely to be in an accident, while people who sit at desks all day get less physical activity.

Research shows that adults who are key workers, i.e. those who work in hospitals, who drive public transport, or work in supermarkets, are more likely to catch the disease. Because they canâ€™t work from home.

You&rsquo;re going to need to use the Employment data to work out which school is at highest risk.
