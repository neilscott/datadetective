<ul>
<li>There are many ways in which our physical and social environments influence health. Researchers use data, such as health records and census data, to understand more about this.</li>
<li>The data that researchers use are only made available under a strict set of conditions, including that the data are anonymised and stored securely</li>
<li>Sometimes data sharing is essential in order to get the right answers.</li>
<li>In these situations, data are shared safely, they are only shared among approved persons, and they are only used to answer pre-specified and approved research questions.</li>
</ul>
