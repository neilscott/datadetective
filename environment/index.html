    <p>The scientists believe that people who live in cities are at highest risk. Because they are busier and it is harder for people to keep 2 meters apart.</p>
<p>Schools that have lots of pupils who live in cities will be most at risk.</p>
<p>You hold neighbourhood data on Glasgow, which tells you which pupils live in cities.</p>
<p>This is really useful data to have, because the environments in which we live can affect our health.</p>
<p>For example, being near green space can help you be physically active, and pollution can affect your breathing. We’ve been told that people who live in cities are more likely to catch the disease, because it is harder to keep a distances from other people.</p>
<p>Schools that have lots of pupils who live in cities will be most at risk of getting the disease first. So you’re going to need to use these data to work out which school is at highest risk.</p>
<h2>Your challenge</h2>
<p>In the data set below, enter the Environmental Risk score for each school. You can get this by calculating the number of children living in cities.</p>
<p>Type in the ID of 'School Zero' (the one with the highest score) and click Submit.</p>
